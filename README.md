# Demo 1
This is a test introduction paragraph to see what text will look like with minimal formatting using this particular template. I do not apply any formatting changes to this paragraph. I tested using indentation at the beginning of this paragraph. Hopefully it works. This is an interesting activity which gives us the opportunity to test out using GitHub Pages.

</body>
````
